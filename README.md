## 🔐 Single Sign-On & Smart Onboarding (Google OAuth 2.0)

The system integrates **Google OAuth 2.0** to provide frictionless patient access while strictly maintaining database integrity for medical records:

- **Two-Step Onboarding (Data Integrity):** Solves the "missing provider data" problem. If a new Google user logs in, the system halts creation and returns a `RequiresCompletion` flag, ensuring mandatory clinic fields (Phone, DateOfBirth, ...) are captured via a dedicated command before generating the JWT.
- **Smart Account Linking:** Automatically detects if a Google email matches an existing traditionally-registered account and authenticates the user instantly without duplicating records.
- **Passwordless Provisioning:** Dynamically provisions verified ASP.NET Identity users (`EmailConfirmed = true`) purely for the `"Patient"` role, without requiring dummy passwords or breaking existing validation rules.

---

## ⚡ Redis Caching & API Security

In this project, **Redis** is used for two main reasons: to make the API run much faster and to protect it from hackers.

### Key Features:
* **Faster Responses (Caching):** Frequently requested data (like available doctor appointments) is saved in Redis. This means the API doesn't have to query the SQL database every time, reducing response times to just a few milliseconds.
* **Smart Cache Updates:** When new data is added (like booking a new appointment), the system only deletes the specific cached data related to it using key prefixes, instead of clearing the whole cache.
* **Blocking Attackers (Rate Limiting):** Redis is used to track user requests. If an IP address or a specific user sends too many requests quickly (like trying to guess a password), the system blocks them. Their IP is added to a "Blacklist" in Redis for 24 hours to stop brute-force attacks.
* **Safe Reconnection:** If the Redis server temporarily disconnects, the application automatically tries to reconnect safely without crashing the whole system.

![Redis](./image/Redis.png)

---

## 🚦 Rate Limiting & Security Auditing (API Protection)

To protect the API from abuse and brute‑force attempts, the system uses **ASP.NET Core Rate Limiting** combined with **Redis** for threat tracking:

- **Global limiter** is enabled for all requests in the pipeline via `app.UseRateLimiter()`.
- Requests are partitioned to enforce fair limits:
  - **Authenticated users** are rate-limited by **User ID** (e.g., 100 requests/min).
  - **Anonymous users** are rate-limited by **IP address** (e.g., 60 requests/min).
- A dedicated `AuthLimiter` policy (Sliding Window) is applied to sensitive endpoints (e.g., login / account actions):
  - **5 requests per minute per IP**.
  - `QueueLimit = 0` (reject immediately once limit is exceeded).
- **Unified Rejection & Threat Tracking (OnRejected):**
  - Returns **HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)** with a standard JSON response.
  - **Security Auditing:** Blocked requests are dynamically intercepted. Attacker metadata (IP address, UserID, Target Endpoint, and Timestamp) is immediately logged via Serilog.
  - **Blacklist Tracking:** The attacker's record is temporarily stored in **Redis** with a 24-hour TTL, laying the groundwork for real-time admin monitoring dashboards.

---

## 🐳 Docker (SQL Server + Redis)

This project includes a `docker-compose.yml` to quickly run the required infrastructure services:

- **SQL Server 2022** container (persistent data via a named volume)
- **Redis** container (used for caching)

### Run containers

> Make sure you have `SQL_PORT`, `SQL_PASSWORD`, and `REDIS_PORT` set (e.g., in your shell environment).

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Stop containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Notes

- SQL Server runs on: `${SQL_PORT}:1433`
- Redis runs on: `${REDIS_PORT}:6379`
- SQL Server data is stored in the `sql_data_new` volume.

## 🐇 Event-Driven Architecture (RabbitMQ & MassTransit)

To ensure high performance, reliability, and loose coupling, the system implements an **Event-Driven Architecture** utilizing **RabbitMQ** as the message broker, orchestrated by **MassTransit**. This transitions the application from a traditional synchronous request-response monolith to a highly scalable, distributed system.

### ✨ Key Implementations & Features:
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Time-consuming infrastructure tasks, such as sending emails (e.g., User Registration, Password Reset, Appointment Confirmations, and Medical Reports), are entirely offloaded to background consumers. This drastically reduced API response times from several seconds to a few milliseconds.
* **Fault Tolerance & Resilience (Retry Policy):** Implemented a robust **Incremental Retry Policy**. If a third-party service (like an SMTP server) experiences a transient network drop, the system automatically retries processing the message with exponential backoff, ensuring zero data loss.
* **Smart Error Handling:** Permanent logical errors (e.g., `ArgumentNullException`) explicitly bypass the retry mechanism and are routed directly to a Dead Letter Queue (Error Queue), conserving CPU resources and keeping logs clean.
* **Architectural Decoupling:** Adhering strictly to Clean Architecture, the Application layer only publishes "Fat Events" containing plain data state. It is completely unaware of how emails are constructed or sent, leaving template rendering and SMTP communication exclusively to the Infrastructure's consumer layer.

### 📊 Live Traffic Monitoring
Below is a snapshot of our RabbitMQ Management Dashboard, actively monitoring message queues, throughput rates, and consumer acknowledgments:

---

## 🚀 Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD Pipeline)

The project utilizes **GitHub Actions** to automate the development lifecycle, ensuring strict code quality and preparing for rapid delivery:

- **Automated Guardrails (CI):** Every push or Pull Request automatically triggers an isolated cloud runner to build and test the `.slnx` solution, preventing broken code or syntax errors from merging into the `main` branch.
- **Future-Ready Delivery (CD):** The workflow architecture is structured to support Continuous Deployment. Once a production server is provisioned, verified builds will be automatically deployed to the live environment, eliminating manual deployment bottlenecks and human errors.

---

## ⚡ Real-Time Notifications & Live Queue (SignalR)

The system uses **SignalR (WebSockets)** to provide instant updates and automate clinic workflows without client-side polling:

- A dedicated `INotificationsService` abstraction is used in the **Application Layer**.
- **Targeted Delivery:** Uses `Clients.User(IdentityUserId)` to securely send private alerts (e.g., new/canceled bookings) ONLY to the specific doctor.
- **Role-Based Broadcasting:** Uses `Clients.Group("Admins")` to instantly notify reception staff when a doctor completes an appointment and the prescription is ready.
- **Stateless Live Queue:** Introduced a `CallPatientCommand` that broadcasts a payload directly to `"WaitingRoomScreens"` for audiovisual alerts without database overhead.
- **Unified Payload:** All events share a standard `NotificationDTO` contract (`Title`, `Message`, `NotificationType`, `RelatedEntityId`) to seamlessly drive frontend UI state.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Login Flow

![Login Flow](./image/Login.png)

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. 👤 User sends credentials (email/username + password) to `/api/authentication/login`
2. 🔍 System validates credentials against database using ASP.NET Identity
3. ✅ If valid and email confirmed, generates JWT Access Token + Refresh Token
4. 💾 Refresh Token saved to database with expiration date
5. 📤 Returns tokens, user info, and roles in response
6. 🔐 Client stores tokens (localStorage/sessionStorage)
7. 🎫 Client includes Access Token in Authorization header for subsequent API requests

**Example Login Request:**
```bash
POST /api/authentication/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "emailOrUserName": "patient1@gmail.com",
  "password": "Patient@123"
}
```

**Example Success Response:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "succeeded": true,
  "message": "Login Successful",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "userName": "patient1",
    "email": "patient1@gmail.com",
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyLXBhdDEiLCJ1bmlxdWVfbmFtZSI6InBhdGllbnQxIiwiZW1haWwiOiJwYXRpZW50MUBnbWFpbC5jb20iLCJqdGkiOiI4YzRhM2YxZS02ZjdhLTRkOGItYjJlYy03ZjVhOWIyYzRkMWEiLCJyb2xlIjoiUGF0aWVudCIsImV4cCI6MTczODQ0MDA3MH0.R3v9x1qQ9kXN7sT8yZ2wL4pF5mN6hJ1bG8tD3yC4xK0",
    "refreshToken": "hG8Lj2RpQm3Tk9Wn6Yz4Cv1Xf7Sb5Da0Ke8Jm4Pq2Vr6",
    "expiresAt": "2026-02-01 22:32:54",
    "roles": ["Patient"]
  }
}
```

---

### Refresh Token Flow

When Access Token expires:

1. 🔄 Client sends expired Access Token + Refresh Token to `/api/authentication/refresh-token`
2. 🔍 System validates Refresh Token from database
3. ✅ If valid and not revoked, generates new Access Token + new Refresh Token
4. 🗑️ Old Refresh Token is revoked in database
5. 💾 New Refresh Token saved to database
6. 📤 Returns new tokens to client

**Token Security Features:**
- ⏰ Short-lived Access Tokens (60 minutes)
- 🔁 Automatic token refresh before expiration
- 🔒 Refresh Token rotation (single-use tokens)
- 💾 Database storage for Refresh Tokens with revocation support
- 🚫 Immediate revocation on logout
- 🕐 Configurable expiration times

---

### Authorization

The system uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with three distinct roles:

## 💻 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK 10.0** or higher ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- **SQL Server** 2019 or higher ([Download](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads))
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code** ([Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/))
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** (optional, for database management)

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adhamdr1/Clinic-System.git
cd Clinic-System
```

#### 2. Restore NuGet Packages
```bash
dotnet restore
```

#### 3. Update Database Connection String

Open `appsettings.json` in the `Clinic System.API` project and update the connection string:

```json
{
  "constr": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=ClinicSystem;Integrated Security=SSPI;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
}
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME` with your SQL Server instance name (e.g., `localhost` or `DESKTOP-XYZ123`).

#### 4. Configure Email Settings (Optional but Recommended)

Update email settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "EmailSettings": {
    "Host": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "Port": 587,
    "FromEmail": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "Password": "your-app-password",
    "SenderName": "Elite Clinic"
  }
}
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you need to use an **App Password** instead of your regular password. See [Google's guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).

#### 5. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
cd "Clinic System.API"
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the database and seed initial data (admin, doctors, patients).

#### 6. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will start at:
- **HTTPS**: `https://localhost:7179`
- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:5129`

#### 7. Access Swagger Documentation

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
https://localhost:7179/swagger
```
